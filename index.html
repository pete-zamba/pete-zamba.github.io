								<h2 class="major">Basic Information</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/info.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>  Born in Coffs Harbour I attended school at Moorland Primary school until the age of 8 where I then moved to Victoria and attended a new school at Porepunkah primary, to which I attended for two more years until moving to Bright P-12 college where I stayed until grade 10. After which I then attended yet another high school where I successfully completed my VCE which is my highest current education. My final school I completed VCE in was a small Rural, Anglican school in Wangaratta called Cathedral college, Wangaratta. Although a small school, which lacked in certain aspects in comparison to more city-oriented schools, it made up for in close interpersonal relationships formed in these places, where I made lifelong friends, however being a small rural area the ability for personal growth was limited, thus formed my decision to relocate to the city centre and attend RMIT University. I currently only speak English however as I plan to <a href="#about">work</a> in a prodominently english based setting.</p>
								<p> Although a priority, I did not leave my rural home town immediately as I wanted to create a broad experience of life that university life could not have given me. In my gap year I predominantly worked the majority of it with brief intermittent travels, such as Bali and general solo road trips around Australia. To fund these travels and to some degree this coming year at university myself I needed to work multiple jobs at a time, often working an average of 70- 80 hours a week. My most memorable jobs for the year would be Working in the pine plantations, of which I planted around 100,000 trees in a 6-month period, and working for a construction company, which allowed me to drive crazy machinery and often big trucks for work. I have however always worked since the age of 13, which had conditioned me to the high level of work, allowing me to enjoy the large levels of work and not feel overwhelmed immediately. Between all the work however I was not given much time pursue my hobbies, of which included mostly playing football for a local team, the bright mountain men, and interestingly enough, sketching. Which is not a collectively acknowledged fact about me. Although throughout the gap year the work affected me in a large way, the impact travelling was able to imprint on me throughout this year had the largest impact on me, which likely shaped the direction of my future unintentionally. </p>

							<h2 class="major">My Interest In I.T</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/interest.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>•	My Interest for I.T was always present from a young age as I was always obsessed with most technology, the spark however, took flame admittedly when I got hooked onto a tv series, Mr. Robot, mostly due to the fact that it clued me onto just how big the world of technology really was, a fact predominantly hidden from most users. I.T to me personally is a vastly interesting subject with a broad range of information to learn and process, however, from my current experiences in the field, programming has truly stood out to me as the most thrilling aspect of the course so far, which is, for the most part, the reason I recently joined the programming club. Although interested, my personal experience in the I.T world however is fairly limited at the moment. Outside of the experiences I have gained already through RMIT, I have only ever briefly experienced certain programming languages such as python and Java as well as building and repairing a few computers.</p>
							<p> 	Why did I choose to come to RMIT?</p>
							<p> My decision for choosing RMIT was not a life-long dream, nor was it a well thought out plan conceived years prior to my attendance. My choice of attending RMIT was a decision solely based through reviews both online and through the people I knew in the years above me who had lived through the experiences of university life, and by most accounts, the RMIT I.T subject was very popular and reputable, therefore placing it as my first preference due to my interests in the area. To my luck I received a letter of attendance some week after my application was submitted, my decision to attend university however, was a plan, pre-conceived years prior. From birth I had always lived in the remote or Rural areas, after 19 years of this it was time that I adopted a change. RMIT city campus appealed to me for this reason in particular as the lifestyle I would have to adapt to completely would ultimately juxtapose the lifestyle I have previously grown accustom to, giving way to extensive personal development through the abundance of new experiences.</p>
							<p>Throughout my imminent course I don’t particularly expect to learn any one thing or any few particular things, as many jobs I may be attending in my future often require me to change, learn and adapt to new styles and information. I would however, hope to learn how to use basic resources that will help me uncover the hidden world of I.T for myself and give me a strong foundation to build upon for future endeavours.
hopefully, this course will secondly give me contact information in I.T for future possible jobs, which is actually a considerably large factor considered upon my joining of the CSIT club, as a means of meeting new people in the field. Other than these things everything else I learn throughout the course is a welcomed effort as I am willing to be taught as I would like to learn much as possible in the I.T field.

							  <h2 class="major">My Ideal Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/idealJob.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> My Ideal job in the I.T department is not necessarily a standard ‘ideal’ job as it is a more personalised contracting jobs in the form of freelancing. Freelancing is a term given to people who do not have a fixed, long term job but instead actively seek out contractual jobs for a fixed payment which will require a specific task to be completed and sometimes sold. A common freelancer could expect to do multiple jobs for multiple people in any given year. In regards to the I.T field, freelancing mainly consists of doing specific jobs such as programming or website development, sometimes even computer engineering projects as well, which is where my focus lies. This job is highly appealing to me as the freedom it could afford is too good to pass up as I do intend on doing extensive travel at some time in my life. While overseas I will be able to work on projects anywhere in the world, at home or abroad, that has a solid connection to the internet. This would allow me to earn money while traveling which only when I need it and when I have free time which, to me, is a great opportunity not commonly found in many other jobs. My inspiration for perusing this job as my ideal job is not through researching these different jobs but rather talking to people from my hometown who have done all most styles of work in the I.T field, and in particular, a woman named Christy who went to university and did the standard 9 to 5 job then quit to become a freelancer seemed to connect with me the most through her stories of being well set in this style of work that would not have been possible for the other people I spoke to who still worked in a fixed salary job.</p>
								<p> The required skills needed for this type of job is an extensive and broad range of knowledge surrounding programming and website development as it appears that a large proportion of the listed jobs mainly revolve around these skill sets as the demand for creating creating specific programs and websites for people is an ever growing demand with the rise in population and popularity for the internet. I do however understand that this type of job is a highly competitive market and external experiences through other, more standardised jobs, will be required in order to have a more ‘appealing’ resume to attract the attention of potential clients. Because of this fact, the job I am describing will be a job that I will have to work for in the future once I have acquired extensive experience from both university and working a fixed salary job to broaden my insight into the field of I.T. </p>
								<p> Currently however, my experience required for my ideal job is very limited as I am a beginner in ux design,  programming in one language (java) and web development, nevertheless, I do hope that by the end of the course I will have a more extensive knowledge in the chosen fields that interest me most to the point that I will be able to , at the very least, efficiently learn the necessary skills for a job in the I.T field to start me off in my career in I.T. </p>
								<p> For future endeavours to acquire these necessary skill sets required to be highly sought after in my ideal job I described earlier, I will need to continually practice and learn several highly used programming languages and increase my knowledge in using html and css for website design. Once at a high enough level of knowledge in these fields I will need to acquire a job somewhere that allows me to further develop these skills, taking me to the next level of knowledge until I feel thoroughly comfortable performing many set tasks given to me. At this point I will be ready to begin making my own way through the competitive and exciting world of freelancing.</p>

							<p>Myers-Briggs Test</p>
							<p> These results for me show that I have a willingness or at the very least a capability to take control of a situation and organise or orient myself efficiently in a way that I believe to be efficient. In a group setting this would indicate that I may attempt to organise and lead the team to reach our set goals. Based on these results, it indicates that I should be okay in most group leadership roles however in a position with no leadership and bad management I may appear to rebel against the leader as I cannot stand for inefficient management. </p>
							<p> Education Planner Learning Style Test </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/test2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml?event=results&A=6&V=6&T=8">click here for link to the Education Planner results.</a> </p>
							<p> •	Auditory: 30%</p>
							<p> •	Visual: 30%</p>
							<p> •	Tactile: 40%</p>
							<p> According to the education planners test results I am able to learn very evenly between all three different learning styles with a slight 10% preference towards being tactile. To me these results confirm to me a suspicion that I had that I don’t really have a specific learning style as I have always found learning in any style to be as efficient as the other. These attributes, in a team environment, is a very handy skill to have as I would be able to relate to all learning styles and suit any group I enter, making group formation in this regard extremely easy for me. </p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/test3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>For my final personality test, I chose to use a Big five personality test to determine what aspects of my personality show the most. According to my test results, I have a general openness to people’s opinions while still being very extroverted and aloud with my opinions and do not have a very large capacity for narcissism or a general tolerance for being pushed into a corner and not being allowed to convey my personal opinion through either my own thoughts and fear or through authority. These test results again support the general theme set out by the previous two personality tests in regards to my willingness to express my personal opinion which would benefit any leadership roles I may need to encounter but also a general openness to having better suggestions guide the any given team I am in. </p>

						<!-- Project -->
						<article id="project">
							<h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/rasp.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p> For my intro to I.t project idea, I will be choosing a project that should help develop the skills I outlined for my ideal job. This such project I chose will be involving myself with Raspberry Pis in an attempt to create an internet speed monitoring device that will detect whether or not the internet is working at an average, above average or below average speed in a simple colour device. For the device, green light will signify good connection speed, orange or yellow will indicate average internet speed and red will indicate no or very slow internet connection.</p>
							<p> My motivation for choosing this project stems from two main reasons. Reason one would be because the development of this device will be a good opportunity to expand on a broad range of skills such as, the basic concepts of an internal computer through the raspberry pi console as well as programming other than HTML and java, which so far are the only two languages I know. The second reason for wanting to create this device is to monitor the internet speed at my current residence, RMIT village, in order to determine if internet connection speed is user problems or actually connection speed. This year there are over 600 people living at the village and on average, roughly 3 to 4 people message the group chat with connection issues a week. With this device I will be able to tell if it is actually the internet or their own computers.</p>
							<p> The raspberry pie internet monitor is designed to give a visual status of a WIFI network using three lights to represent slow, average and fast internet speed using red orange and green lighting, with green being fast and red being slow or no internet connection. The raspberry pi will occasionally use Linux ping commands to a few websites in order to determine the connection speed and based on these pings, a light will be turned on to represent success of these pings. The allotting of the lights in reference to the ping success is based on the percent of success the pings have. If the pings are successful 50% of the time or more, the respective green light will be flicked on, if there is a 1% to 50% success, the respective orange light will be turned on and if there is no successful ping the red light will be turned on. The device itself will be housed by a wooden box with a cylindrical lighting tower protruding from the top of the box, with red lighting at the bottom, then orange and then green at the top. Inside the box, a raspberry pi model B will be required along with a circuit for controlling the lights and power button. Inside the raspberry pie, two programs codded in python will be required to run the ping operations, one that controls the shutdown switch and the other that monitors the internet connections. If all works as expected, the product should simplify the process of testing internet speed to a simple glace at some lights. It will also hopefully reduce the question of what is at fault for slow or no internet connection out of user problems or network problem. </p>
							<p> The equipment needed for this project idea would mainly revolve around the raspberry pi, more specifically, the raspberry pi model 3. Other materials involved in the process of making this is a wooden box, circuitry for the lights, light of green orange and red colour. Along with the hardware for this project, an additional two python code programs will be required for this product to work. These codes will be in control of both the ping sent out to determine internet speed and also the shut-down command</p>
							<p>Along with the equipment needed for this project, there will also be a necessary requirement for certain skills to successfully build this project. These skills may include, a knowledge in basic woodworks, in order to build the wooden box case and light tower, basic knowledge in circuitry, in order to successfully hook the lights and power button up properly and a basic understanding of how to code using python and use Linux, in order to program the raspberry pi. Other skills that may come in handy for this project may also include a good understanding of the systems involved in a computer system. These skills necessary to complete this project are all required but at a very basic understanding of each, making it very feasible for uni students to achieve. Along with this these requirements, the necessary equipment for building this product also is very feasible as all the equipment is quite cheap to buy or make. </p>
							<p> If this product proves to be successful, the outcome will be a completely simplified system of checking internet speed as well as a quick and reliable way of determining who is at fault out of the user or the network in terms of internet connection. The problem of easier internet speed monitorization will be solved by having a remote and highly visible lighting tower that is easy to see and easily recognizable in terms of the meaning each coloured light will represent. In terms of fixing the problem of determining if the users personal computer is at fault of the internet network, the product achieves a cheap fix as the raspberry pi can act independently from the users personal computer or phone and solely focus on internet connection leaving little to no room for personal error to effect the readings of the internet speed. The impact this product will have on the user will be efficient convenience of the monitorization of any wifi network.</p>
