								<p>Born in Coffs Harbour I attended school at Moorland Primary school until the age of 8 where I then moved to Victoria and attended a new school at Porepunkah primary school, to which I attended for two more years until moving to Bright P-12 college where I stayed until grade 10. After which I then attended yet another high school where I successfully completed my VCE which is my highest current education. My final school I completed VCE in was a small Rural, Anglican school in Wangaratta called Cathedral college, Wangaratta. Although a small school, which lacked in certain aspects  in comparison to more city oriented schools, it made up for in close interpersonal relationships formed in these places, where I made life long friends, however being a small rural area the ability for personal growth was limited, thus formed my decision to relocate to the city centre and attend RMIT University. I currently only speak English however.</p>
								<p>I did not however leave my rural town immediately as I wanted to create a broad experience of life that university life could not have given me. In my gap year I predominantly worked the majority of it with brief intermittent travels, such as bali and general solo road trips around Australia. To fund these travels and to some degree this coming year at university myself I needed to work multiple jobs at a time, often working an average of 70- 80 hours a week. My most memorable jobs for the year would be Working in the pine plantations, of which I planted around 100,000 trees in a 6 month period, and working for a construction company, which allowed me to drive crazy machinery and often big trucks for work. I have however always worked since the age of 13, which had conditioned me to the high level of work, allowing me to enjoy the large levels of work and not feel overwhelmed immediately. Between all the work however I was not given much time pursue my hobbies, of which included mostly playing football for a local team, the bright mountain men, and interestingly enough, sketching. Which is not a collectively acknowledged fact about me. Although throughout the gap year the work affected me in a large way, the impact travelling  was able to imprint on me  throughout this year had the largest impact on me, which likely shaped the direction of my future unintentionally.</p>

							<article id="Interest in I.T">
								<h2 class="major">Interest in I.T</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>

								<p> Question 1</p>
							 <p>•	My Interest for I.T was always present from a young age as I was always obsessed with most technology, the spark however, took flame admittedly when I got hooked onto a tv series, Mr. Robot, mostly due to the fact that it clued me onto just how big the world of technology really was, a fact predominantly hidden from most users. I.T to me personally is a vastly interesting subject with a broad range of information to learn and process, however, from my current experiences in the field, programming has truly stood out to me as the most thrilling aspect of the course so far, which is, for the most part, the reason I recently joined the programming club. Although interested, my personal experience in the I.T world however is fairly limited at the moment. Outside of the experiences I have gained already through RMIT, I have only ever briefly experienced certain programming languages such as python and Java as well as building and repairing a few computers.</p>

							 <p> Question 2 </p>
								<p> -My decision for choosing RMIT was not a life-long dream, nor was it a well thought out plan conceived years prior to my attendance. My choice of attending RMIT was a decision solely based through reviews both online and through the people I knew in the years above me who had lived through the experiences of university life, and by most accounts, the RMIT I.T subject was very popular and reputable, therefore placing it as my first preference due to my interests in the area. To my luck I received a letter of attendance some week after my application was submitted, my decision to attend university however, was a plan, pre-conceived years prior.
              	From birth I had always lived in the remote or Rural areas, after 19 years of this it was time that I adopted a change. RMIT city campus appealed to me for this reason in particular as the lifestyle I would have to adapt to completely would ultimately juxtapose the lifestyle I have previously grown accustom to, giving way to extensive personal development through the abundance of new experienc</p>
								</article>

							 <p> Question 3 </p>
							 <p> Throughout my imminent course I don’t particularly expect to learn any one thing or any few particular things, as many jobs I may be attending in my future often require me to change, learn and adapt to new styles and information. I would however, hope to learn how to use basic resources that will help me uncover the hidden world of I.T for myself and give me a strong foundation to build upon for future endeavours.
                 hopefully, this course will secondly give me contact information in I.T for future possible jobs, which is actually a considerably large factor considered upon my joining of the CSIT club, as a means of meeting new people in the field. Other than these things everything else I learn throughout the course is a welcomed effort as I am willing to be taught as I would like to learn much as possible in the I.T field.</p>
